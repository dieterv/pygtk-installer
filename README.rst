===============

The pygtk-installer project contains:
- a tool that build windows installer packages (both .exe and .msi) for pygtk and dependencies.
- a tool that uses the separate installers created above and generates an all-in-one installer.

.. CAUTION::
    The all-in-one installer should be considered as a proof of concept.
    Please do not use it on productions systems just yet.
