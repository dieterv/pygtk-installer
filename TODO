- Finish the feature tree (it currently doesn't represent
  the actual dependency tree).

- Detect the presence of the separate pyg* .exe and .msi
  installers (we wouldn't want to overwrite them...).

- As the all-in-one installer is based on a Python 2.7
  distutils generated .msi file, it offers the possibility
  to install into multiple Python installations.
  That's great for pure Python modules/packages where you
  can install the package into python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, etc
  at once. It isn't really applicable for c extensions
  though. Removing that capability would simplify thing
  a lot (but we should retain some choise in the form of
  "install into automatically detected python" or "user
  specified directory")

- The dialogs used in the installer could use some work...
